\begin{enumerate} 

\item Consider the following cubic polynomial
\[
p(x) = 816 x^3 - 3835 x^2 + 6000 x  - 3125.  
\] 
It has three three closely spaced roots: $25/15, 25/16, 25/17$ 

(a) Plot $p(x)$ for $1.43 \leq x \leq 1.71$. 
Show the location of the three roots. 

(b) Starting with the interval [1,2], what does the bisection method do? 

(b) Starting with $x_0 = 1.5$, what does Newton's method do? 

(c) Starting with $x_0 = 1$ and $x_1 = 2$, what does the secant
metod do? 

\item Investigate the behavior of the secant method on the function
\[
f(x) = \mbox{sign}(x-2) \sqrt{|x - 2|} 
\] 
{\em Hint: start from ``Example Newton 2'' from our class website.} 

\item Let 
\[
f(x_1,x_2) = \frac{1}{2}(x^2_1 - x_2)^2 + \frac{1}{2}(1-x_1)^2
\] 

(a) What is the minimizer of $f(x_1,x_2)$? 

(b) Compute one iteration of Newton's method for minimizing
$f(x_1,x_2)$ starting from the point $(2,2)$. Is this a good step? 

\item Let 
\[
f(x_1,x_2) = \frac{1}{2}x^2_1 + \frac{9}{2}x^2_2. 
\] 
It's easy to see that the minimizer is $x_{\ast} = (0,0)$

(a) Derive the steepest descent method for finding the minimzer of 
of $f(x)$. 

(b) Compute the first four iterations starting from the point $(9,1)$.

\end{enumerate}
