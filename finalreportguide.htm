<h3>
ECS 130 Final Project Report Guideline<br>
</h3>

<ul> 
<li> Project report consists of five components: background, aim(s), method(s), 
and conclusion(s), and may organized as follows: 
     <p> 
     <ol>   
     <li> Title and Author(s) (ID and email address)  
     <li> Abstract (summary, few sentences to highlight major issues and 
          findings)
     <li> Introduction (background etc)
     <li> Related definitions, concepts and theory
     <li> Algorithm(s)
     <li> Discussion on implementation issues, such as functions used, 
          input/output and stopping criterion. 
     <li> Experiment results:<br> 
          <ul> 
          <li> what is the objective of numerical examples <br> 
          <li> where is the data from.<br> 
          <li> report numerical results to show the correctness and
              efficiency of your algorithm(s) and/or implementation(s)
               in data tables or graphs. 
          <li> state that whether the results meet the objective <br> 
          </ul> 
     <li> Concluding remarks: summarize what have you learned 
          and what are remaining issues for further study.
     <li> Acknowledgement (collaborator and helper if any) 
     <li> References
     </ol>   

<p> 
<li> Note: You need to provide a self-contained presentation about the topic 
     you worked, and use the experimental data to 
     to illustrate and support your findings. 

<p> 
<li> The report is no less than 4 pages but not more than 6 pages<br> 
     <font color="red"><i> include your codes as appendix, which will not be counted
      towards the page limit</i> </font>


<p> 
<li> <font color="red"> Upload your report in the pdf format and 
     implementation codes to canvas before 6:00pm, March 20, 2017. </font> 
</ul>
